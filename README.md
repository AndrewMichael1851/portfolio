# portfolio
This is a basic portfolio I put together using vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Project Summary

In this project, I want to build a full portfolio that meets my personal design preferences from scratch. By completing this project, I will demonstrate an ability to use HTML, CSS, and basic Javascript to create a functioning website.

This project is currently on hold while I work on The Odin Project. Recent changes are generally my playing with basic concepts from those lessons.
